I am an Assistant Professor at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University.

My research interest lies at the intersection of international trade and economic development. My current research focuses on the role that foreign affiliates of multinational firms can play in the economic development of their host economies.

I received my Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Michigan in 2024. I also hold a Master in Public Administration in International Development (MPAID) from John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
