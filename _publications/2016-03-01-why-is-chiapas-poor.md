excerpt: ' This paper is an attempt to determine the factors associated with the wage gap between Chiapas and the rest of Mexico. We find that Chiapas is not poor solely because it has a low endowment of factors compared to the rest of Mexico, but because the diversity of its factors of production does not allow it to produce many, more complex, goods that they could sell outside the state.'
