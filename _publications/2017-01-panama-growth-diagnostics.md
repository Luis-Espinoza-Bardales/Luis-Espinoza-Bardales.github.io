excerpt: 'This paper explores export diversification opportunities and studies the potential binding constraints that Panama can run into in the process of shifting gears towards a sustainable economic growth. We recommend that Panama must increase its stock of human capital by improving the quality of education and removing restrictions to high-skilled immigraton. In addition, Panama must strengthen its institutions and reduce red tape and corruption, which most firms considered the most binding constraint to growth.'
