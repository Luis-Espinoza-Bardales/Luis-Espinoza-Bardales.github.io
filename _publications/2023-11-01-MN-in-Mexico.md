excerpt: 'I explore how contracting frictions and geography influence the trade costs faced by multinationals in their affiliates located in Mexico relative to domestic firms. I document two key facts. First, distance to firm’s home countries influences firms’ sourcing patterns. Second, sectors with a larger presence of foreign affiliates are more intensive in relationship-specific inputs. I develop a small open economy model with multiple sectors, imperfect contracting, input relationship-specificity, global sourcing and multinational production. I compute a set of counterfactual equilibria to gauge the relative importance of contracting frictions, trade costs, and productivity in the price advantage of multinationals over domestic firms. My findings show that, contrary to priors, foreign firms seem to have a disadvantage relative to domestic firms in trade costs and contracting frictions. Eliminating differences in contracting frictions between foreign and domestic firms leads to a reduction in real GNP of 2.7 percent, while doing so only for productivity reduces real GNP by 2.2 percent.'
